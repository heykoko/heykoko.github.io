Hi I'm Karyn Ho. A Full-Stack Software Developer with a background in Communications. At my previous role, I worked in a dynamic Technology start-up as a payment operations associate where I discovered my curiosity for building software and solving inefficiencies.

Working in an emerging start-up environment at RigUp in Austin, Texas. It was a great experience to be able to work cross functionally with the software engineering, product management, and other operations teams to improve the vendor invoicing portal for a new commercial workflow project. There I saw the importance of developing scalable and efficient software and became committed to learning more about software engineering.
