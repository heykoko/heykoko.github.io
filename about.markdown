Hi! I'm Karyn Ho. A Full-Stack Software Developer in Singapore.

I have recently graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive, which is a 420-hour full-time program providing experience with both front- and back-end programming languages, tools, and methodologies including: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Python, Django, NodeJS, ReactJS, Git, Github.

I have a background in Telecommunications & Media Studies from my Bachelor's Education at Texas A&M University. Previously, I worked in a dynamic Technology start-up as a payment operations associate where I discovered my curiosity for building software and solving inefficiencies.

Working in an emerging start-up environment at RigUp in Austin, Texas. It was a great experience to be able to work cross functionally with the software engineering, product management, and other operations teams to improve the vendor invoicing portal for a new commercial workflow project. There I saw the importance of developing scalable and efficient software and became committed to learning more about software engineering.
